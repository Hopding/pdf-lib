/**
 * Encodes a string to UTF-8.
 *
 * @param input The string to be encoded.
 * @param byteOrderMark Whether or not a byte order marker (BOM) should be added
 *                      to the start of the encoding. (default `true`)
 * @returns A Uint8Array containing the UTF-8 encoding of the input string.
 *
 * -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *
 * JavaScript strings are composed of Unicode code points. Code points are
 * integers in the range 0 to 1,114,111 (0x10FFFF). When serializing a string,
 * it must be encoded as a sequence of words. A word is typically 8, 16, or 32
 * bytes in size. As such, Unicode defines three encoding forms: UTF-8, UTF-16,
 * and UTF-32. These encoding forms are described in the Unicode standard [1].
 * This function implements the UTF-8 encoding form.
 *
 * -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *
 * In UTF-8, each code point is mapped to a sequence of 1, 2, 3, or 4 bytes.
 * Note that the logic which defines this mapping is slightly convoluted, and
 * not as straightforward as the mapping logic for UTF-16 or UTF-32. The UTF-8
 * mapping logic is as follows [2]:
 *
 * â€¢ If a code point is in the range U+0000..U+007F, then view it as a 7-bit
 *   integer: 0bxxxxxxx. Map the code point to 1 byte with the first high order
 *   bit set to 0:
 *
 *       b1=0b0xxxxxxx
 *
 * â€¢ If a code point is in the range U+0080..U+07FF, then view it as an 11-bit
 *   integer: 0byyyyyxxxxxx. Map the code point to 2 bytes with the first 5 bits
 *   of the code point stored in the first byte, and the last 6 bits stored in
 *   the second byte:
 *
 *       b1=0b110yyyyy    b2=0b10xxxxxx
 *
 * â€¢ If a code point is in the range U+0800..U+FFFF, then view it as a 16-bit
 *   integer, 0bzzzzyyyyyyxxxxxx. Map the code point to 3 bytes with the first
 *   4 bits stored in the first byte, the next 6 bits stored in the second byte,
 *   and the last 6 bits in the third byte:
 *
 *       b1=0b1110zzzz    b2=0b10yyyyyy    b3=0b10xxxxxx
 *
 * â€¢ If a code point is in the range U+10000...U+10FFFF, then view it as a
 *   21-bit integer, 0bvvvzzzzzzyyyyyyxxxxxx. Map the code point to 4 bytes with
 *   the first 3 bits stored in the first byte, the next 6 bits stored in the
 *   second byte, the next 6 bits stored in the third byte, and the last 6 bits
 *   stored in the fourth byte:
 *
 *       b1=0b11110xxx    b2=0b10zzzzzz    b3=0b10yyyyyy    b4=0b10xxxxxx
 *
 * -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *
 * It is important to note, when iterating through the code points of a string
 * in JavaScript, that if a character is encoded as a surrogate pair it will
 * increase the string's length by 2 instead of 1 [4]. For example:
 *
 * ```
 * > 'a'.length
 * 1
 * > 'ðŸ’©'.length
 * 2
 * > 'èªž'.length
 * 1
 * > 'aðŸ’©èªž'.length
 * 4
 * ```
 *
 * The results of the above example are explained by the fact that the
 * characters 'a' and 'èªž' are not represented by surrogate pairs, but 'ðŸ’©' is.
 *
 * Because of this idiosyncrasy in JavaScript's string implementation and APIs,
 * we must "jump" an extra index after encoding a character as a surrogate
 * pair. In practice, this means we must increment the index of our for loop by
 * 2 if we encode a surrogate pair, and 1 in all other cases.
