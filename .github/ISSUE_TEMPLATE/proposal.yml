        Thanks for taking the time to submit a proposal!
        
        In most cases, [discussions](https://github.com/Hopding/pdf-lib/discussions) are a better place to submit feedback and discuss ideas. This form is meant for ideas that have a clear path to implementation. You should only use this form to submit a proposal if:
        * You have a specific idea in mind to improve `pdf-lib`.
        * You've done your research.
        * You've read [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/Hopding/pdf-lib/blob/master/docs/CONTRIBUTING.md) and understand what involved in making a change to `pdf-lib`.
        * You've read the sections of the PDF specification listed [here](https://github.com/Hopding/pdf-lib/blob/master/docs/CONTRIBUTING.md#understanding-pdfs).
        * You can describe a technical approach to implementing your idea.

        If you still think this is the right form to propose you're idea, then please fill it out. We love well thought out, detailed, technical proposals! ðŸ’–

        Keep the following in mind when filling out this form:
        * Be sure to answer **all** of the questions below.
        * Provide lots of detail. Too much info is better than not enough.

        (These posts are focused more on issues/questions, but can still help you write a good proposal).
