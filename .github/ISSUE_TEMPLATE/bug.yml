      description: |
        üì£ _This is a very important part of your report._

        Provide **complete**, **executable** code that can be used to reproduce the bug (e.g. a git repo, ZIP file, or JSFiddle). You must attach (or provide links to) any PDFs, images, or other files necessary to run your code.

        Your code example should be a [SSCCE](http://www.sscce.org/):
        - Short (Small) - Don't include code that is irrelevant or unnecessary.
        - Self Contained - Ensure everything is included, ready to go.
        - Correct - No additional code or changes are needed to copy, paste, and execute it. 
        - Example - Demonstrates the problem you are reporting.

        Please also type out a list of specific steps we can take to run your code and reproduce the issue. Depending on what you're reporting, this might be simple as running a JSFiddle or downloading a ZIP file and executing `node index.js`. Some issues will require more instructions. 

        > If you are unable to share certain files (e.g. confidential PDFs), then state this in your response. Be prepared to share the files privately (e.g. via email). If you are unable to do this then we probably can't fix the issue.
     
        ‚ö†Ô∏è If your response includes incomplete code or doesn't clearly state how to execute the code you've provided, your report will be closed without comment.
        
        üíñ Thank you for taking the time to create a well-defined report! This helps reduce the demand placed on maintainers trying to help you. We want to make this a pleasant, efficient process for both you and us!
