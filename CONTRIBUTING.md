## Local Setup And Prerequisites

You can develop `pdf-lib` on Windows, Mac, or Linux machines. While most of the original code was developed on a Mac, care has been taken to ensure that all scripts and commands used during development are platform independent. (If you find anything that doesn't work on your machine/platform, please create an Issue or submit a PR!)

In order to work on `pdf-lib`, please ensure you have installed the following:

* **Node.js** provides the runtime needed to run this project. ([Installation instructions](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)).
* **Yarn** is the package manager used for this project. ([Installation instructions](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install)).
* **Git** is the SCM used for this project. ([Installation instructions](https://git-scm.com/downloads))
